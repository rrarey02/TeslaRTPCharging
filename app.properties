# Number of seconds to wait between calls out to ComEd's API. We use the 5-minute price API so you shouldn't set this to more than 300 seconds.
# Also ComEd's API doesn't update on a specific second, so setting this to a high number may cause you to miss an update. 15-60 seconds is recommended.

# Minimum SoC you want the vehicle to have at your set departure time. When the program determines that your vehicle's current SoC

# The approximate SoC% you will gain per hour when charging at full current. This is used with MINIMUM_DEPARTURE_SOC to help decide
# when charging absolutely must start. Tesla's API doesn't report your total battery capacity and we (currently) don't want to have

# Y/N flag for whether charging should restart when charging current drops below the requested level.
# This is useful for chargers that share a circuit with other devices that draw power intermittently and may cause the charger to lower its current when the other device runs.
# For example, a charger plugged in to an outlet in the garage, on a circuit that also supports the garage door openers. Opening a garage door may cause the charger to reduce
# its charging current, which makes sense but the charger almost never increases the current later!
# Setting this flag to Y will cause the app to tell the car to stop charging, pause, and then start charging again when it detects this situation.
# Note that enabling this feature will make the program poll your vehicle more often.
